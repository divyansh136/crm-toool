Building a Perfect AI-Powered Tyre Business Marketing App with Bolt.new
This guide enhances your provided specification to ensure Bolt.new, an AI-powered web development tool, builds a 100% working, error-free application for your wholesale truck tyre business in Jaipur. The app automates customer segmentation and email marketing, integrating Google services (Drive, Gmail, OAuth) and OpenAI’s GPT for AI-driven insights. Below, we outline how to use Bolt.new effectively, with detailed prompts, setup instructions, and strategies to ensure reliability, scalability, and user-friendliness.
Overview of Bolt.new
Bolt.new is a powerful platform that generates full-stack code based on user prompts, supporting technologies like React.js, Node.js, and PostgreSQL. It simplifies development by:

Generating production-ready code for frontend, backend, and database.
Supporting integrations with external APIs (e.g., Google, OpenAI).
Offering features like “Enhance Prompt” to refine user instructions.
Allowing iterative development with real-time previews.

To achieve a perfect app, we’ll break down your specification into incremental prompts, address edge cases, and ensure comprehensive testing and deployment.
Enhanced Specification for Bolt.new
1. Project Setup
Objective: Initialize a full-stack application with the specified tech stack.Prompt:
Create a full-stack web application for a wholesale truck tyre business in Jaipur. Use React.js with TypeScript and Material-UI for the frontend, Node.js with Express.js for the backend, and PostgreSQL via Supabase for the database. Set up Vite as the build tool and include environment variables for sensitive data (e.g., API keys). Create a .bolt/prompt file with the system prompt: 'Use Material-UI with a professional blue (#1976D2) and gray (#424242) color scheme, Roboto font, and Material Icons. Ensure all code is modular and follows B2B design standards.'

Enhancements:

Use Supabase for managed PostgreSQL, simplifying database setup.
Ensure modular project structure for maintainability.
Set up environment variables for secure configuration.

Setup Instructions:

Sign up for a Supabase account at supabase.com to get a PostgreSQL database URL.
Create a .env file with variables like DATABASE_URL, OPENAI_API_KEY, GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID, and GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET.

2. Authentication and Security
Objective: Implement secure Google OAuth 2.0 authentication.Prompt:
Implement Google OAuth 2.0 authentication with scopes: https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.readonly, https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.send, https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.email, and https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.profile. Store refresh tokens securely in the database with encryption. Use Passport.js for authentication and JWT for session management with a 24-hour expiration. Handle OAuth errors (e.g., token refresh failures) and notify users clearly.

Enhancements:

Encrypt refresh tokens using a secure algorithm (e.g., AES-256).
Enforce HTTPS for all API communications.
Log authentication attempts for auditing.

Setup Instructions:

Create a Google Cloud project at console.cloud.google.com.
Enable Google Drive API v3 and Gmail API v1.
Create OAuth 2.0 credentials and add them to the .env file.

3. Google Drive Integration
Objective: Allow users to browse and select CSV files from Google Drive.Prompt:
Add a feature to browse folders and select CSV files from the user's Google Drive using Google Drive API v3. Display file details (name, size, modification date) in a list with breadcrumb navigation. Download selected CSV files and parse them using csv-parser. Validate required columns (Customer Name, Email, Dealer Type, Business Type) and optional columns (Tyre Size, Last Order Date, Payment Status, Customer Tier, Fleet Size, Location). Handle malformed CSVs or missing columns with user-friendly error messages. Implement pagination for large file lists.

Enhancements:

Cache folder structures to reduce API calls.
Allow users to map CSV columns if headers differ.
Process large CSVs asynchronously to avoid blocking the UI.

4. AI Processing with OpenAI
Objective: Segment customers and generate personalized emails using OpenAI.Prompt:
Integrate OpenAI GPT-3.5 or GPT-4 API to analyze customer data and return JSON with segment classification (e.g., Truck Tyre Dealer – High Volume, Fleet Operator – Inactive) and personalized email content (max 120 words, subject max 8 words). Use the system prompt: 'You are an AI assistant for a wholesale truck tyre business in Jaipur, India. Analyze customer data, classify into segments, and generate professional B2B email content.' Handle API errors, rate limits, and invalid JSON responses with retries (exponential backoff) and fallback segmentation (e.g., default to 'New Customer'). Store the API key securely in environment variables.

Enhancements:

Track API usage and costs in the api_usage_logs table.
Implement batch processing for large customer datasets.
Validate JSON responses for structure and content length.

Setup Instructions:

Sign up for OpenAI at platform.openai.com and obtain an API key.
Add the key to the .env file as OPENAI_API_KEY.

5. Email Sending with Gmail API
Objective: Send personalized emails using the user’s Gmail account.Prompt:
Integrate Gmail API v1 to send emails from the user's Gmail account. Use a professional HTML email template with a blue header (#1976D2), gray content area (#f9f9f9), and Arial font. Implement a queue system for batch sending to handle large volumes (e.g., 100+ emails). Track delivery status (sent, failed, bounced) in the email_logs table. Handle Gmail API rate limits and authentication errors with user notifications. Allow users to preview and edit emails before sending.

Enhancements:

Use a background job queue (e.g., Bull) for asynchronous email sending.
Respect Gmail’s sending limits (100 emails/day/user).
Provide retry mechanisms for failed sends.

6. User Interface Design
Objective: Create a professional, intuitive UI for non-technical users.Prompt:
Design a responsive UI with Material-UI using blue (#1976D2) and gray (#424242) colors, Roboto font, and Material Icons.

Add a setup wizard for first-time users to connect Google accounts and select CSVs. Include tooltips and in-app help.

Enhancements:

Implement a card-based layout for clarity.
Add a sample CSV template for users to download.
Ensure mobile responsiveness for tablets and phones.

7. Database Schema
